- Can run programs on current link/document;
- A huge variety of options and customization;
- Has search option;
- Can directly save or mail the document;
- Can visualize raw HTML.


## [Cons](#)
- Abandoned project, the last version is dated to 08 Jul 2018;
- Scrolling with a touchpad works unexpected, can scroll too fast, move to the previous pages and slow down the app;
- Unique keybindings, not similar to vim/emacs, which might confuse newbies;
- Scrolling requires two keys pressed at the same time, except scrolling using arrow keys/sometimes page up/down depending on the keyboard;
- Hard to see the changes (accepting cookies, switching to another link/button);
- Can't open plain text.

## [Improvements](#)
- Default keybindings to be vim-like for a better user adaptability;
- A more intuitive scroll system.
