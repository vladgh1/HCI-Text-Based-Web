<h2 id="description"><a href="#">Description</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we will examine TUI (Text User Interface) browsers.
Among all the variety of similar apps, I have decided to analyze lynx as
being the most popular TUI browser, links as an alternative to lynx, and
browsh as providing the most similar experience with regular GUI
one.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: For an enhanced experience, you can analyze the
following documents with the proposed browsers.</p>
<p>Before starting, let’s take a closer look at the browsers and see how
each browser identifies itself as. The following descriptions are taken
from their official sites.</p>
<h3 id="lynx">Lynx</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kurtchen/Lynx">Lynx</a> is a
fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices such as vt100
terminals, vt100 emulators running on Windows 95/NT or Macintoshes, or
any other character-cell display. It will display HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) documents containing links to files on the local system,
as well as files on remote systems running HTTP, gopher, FTP, wais,
nntp, finger, or cso/ph/qi servers, and services accessible via logins
to telnet, tn3270 or rlogin accounts. Current versions of Lynx run on
Unix, VMS, Windows95 through Windows 8, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.</p>
<p>Lynx can be used to access information on the WWW, or to establish
information systems intended primarily for local access. Lynx has been
used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS). Lynx can
also be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.</p>
<h3 id="links">Links</h3>
<p><a href="http://links.twibright.com/about.php">Links</a> is a web
browser running in both graphics and text mode. Mikuláš Patočka started
writing Links (text mode those days) in 1999. In 2000 Marting Pergel,
Petr Kulhavý and Karel Kulhavý joined the project to add graphics and
Javascript capabilities into Links together with Mikuláš Patočka. The
program has been written mainly as a hobby and also as a school
project.</p>
<h3 id="browsh">Browsh</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.brow.sh">Browsh</a> is a fully-modern text-based
browser. It renders anything that a modern browser can; HTML5, CSS3, JS,
video and even WebGL. Its main purpose is to be run on a remote server
and accessed via SSH/Mosh or the in-browser HTML service in order to
significantly reduce bandwidth and thus both increase browsing speeds
and decrease bandwidth costs.</p>
<p>On this page, we will analyze TUI browsers as a whole, rather than
individually. A more detailed information regarding each browser
individually can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="browser/lynx.html">Lynx</a></li>
<li><a href="browser/links.html">Links</a></li>
<li><a href="browser/browsh.html">Browsh</a></li>

<h2 id="browser-interaction"><a href="#">Browser Interaction</a></h2>
<h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>
<p>Every person has its own approach on using a web browser, so the
browser should be customizable and extendable.</p>
<p>As for browsh, even if it gives an experience similar to a GUI one,
it lacks tons of features and customization.</p>
<p>Links is more user-friendly when it comes to customization. It can be
done via the menu bar, and it separates HTML customization from terminal
one. One flaw of it is that the configuration should be saved manually,
and the user isn’t notified about it.</p>
<h3 id="help-section">Help Section</h3>
<p>For both browsh and lynx, the help section is more accessible to a
new user. On the other hand, it’s way harder to find the help section
for the first time in links browser. When opening the browser without
any URL given, it displays an empty screen, and the user is confused
rather than it’s working or not.</p>
<h3 id="browsing">Browsing</h3>
<p>Browsing a web resource for both links and lynx (and similar
browsers) might be hard because of the structure of a modern page. While
having a menu with hidden elements somewhere on top of the screen is
relevant for a GUI browser, it’s hard to navigate to the content on a
TUI app. Browish handles such issues, as the page is rendered as a
normal one, then it’s displayed on a terminal in a pixelated form.</p>
<p>Another problem might be browsing local files such as Markdown or TeX
documents or even emails. Links can do this ob better, lynx doesn’t open
plain-text documents while browsh can’t open local files at all.</p>
<p>Navigating through the application using keybindings only might be an
easier task for an experienced user. Basic key combinations are also
easy to remember: CTRL+n which comes from ‘next’ or CTRL+p which comes
from ‘previous’, CTRL+b from ‘back’ and so on. As for browsh, it’s using
the same combinations as a graphical browser.</p>
<h2 id="tui-vs-gui"><a href="#">TUI vs GUI</a></h2>
<p>Next we will compare the difference between surfing the web using a
GUI and a TUI application. Because browsh provides an experience similar
to GUI apps, it will be left of out the scope for this section.</p>
<p>Most web pages are designed to work properly mainly on three engines:
blink for chrome-like browsers, gecko for firefox-like browsers and
WebKit for safari, and only a small percentage of web resources are
adapted to TUI browsers like links and lynx. And when it comes to
viewing a resource, this can be a painful task, even impossible
sometimes (<a href="https://youtube.com">youtube</a> for example).</p>
<p>There are some protocols like gopher that are only supported by the
lynx, and can’t be opened other than specialized browsers. Other
protocols like FTP are both accessible by links and lynx.</p>
<p>Overall, even if some particular information could be found, it’s a
more painful experience for the user than using a regular GUI browser.
Nevertheless, some tasks might be easier to manage on a TUI browser,
which includes working with outdated and low-resource machines, using
different protocols for communication or even remotely browsing the web
via SSH protocol.</p>
<h2 id="improvements"><a href="#">Improvements</a></h2>
<h3 id="fitts-law">Fitts’ Law</h3>
<p>For both links and lynx, scrolling through the page can be improved
by using just one key instead of two. In this case, scrolling could be
done using just one hand, similar to scrolling in vim. On the other
hand, browsh has no keybinding to click on external links, so you have
to use a mouse or touchpad. While it’s more convenient for some users,
others might experience some frustration.</p>
<p>As for browsing the web, nearly every web source has a list menu with
links to the different areas of the site. This list might be long and
scrolling to the page content might take a longer time than expected and
be a painful experience.</p>
<h3 id="hicks-law">Hick’s Law</h3>
<p>The number of scrolling options in lynx is too excessive and split
far apart. To move two lines, you should press CTRL+n (next) and CTRL+p
(previous). For half a page, scroll is ‘(’ and ‘)’. It’s confusing even
for two lines scroll, having this many unrelated options might be
frustrating for the user.</p>
<h3 id="steerings-law">Steering’s Law</h3>
<p>The help section of lynx is, basically, an HTML document with
multiple links to other documents. Navigating it and searching for some
information might take a while. Not to mention that there are external
non-working links. On the other hand, links has a more intuitive and
user-friendly menu that also shows some basic keybindings along with the
action they do.</p>
<p>Another frustration point is, as I’ve mentioned above, a big section
of links on a typical web resource that’s supposed to be a menu bar in
the graphical browser. If the browser could manage to extract them all
in a separated section/panel of external links, called by a keybinding,
both the content and the menu would be easily accessible, and the user
won’t have to scroll the menu all the time.</p>
